          <p>I have been planning this Walk for over a year and I have been anxious to be on the way for almost a year. It is finally within sight! May first is my tentative start date. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad for the pressure of getting things planed and also moving all of my stuff, it is a good break from the monotony and helps to keep me motivated these last few weeks.A part of me feels unprepared for this. How can I expect to walk 2,600 miles? How does one even begin to plan such a thing? Sure you read the books and guides, check out the experience of those who have gone before, but ultimately it is something that cannot be prepared for. The doing is the preparation. Of course, I have taken the standard precautions and steps to get my mind and body ready, but there is only so much one can do. Ultimately I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would want it any other way. I can see the temptation when undertaking something like this to over-prepare. To know every night where I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sleep, figure out down to the calorie what food I\xe2\x80\x99m going to eat, etc. There comes a point where the power of the unknown is emasculated; If all risk is taken out this would not be a worth challenge. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine balance, in the Boy Scouts I was taught the maxim \xe2\x80\x9cBe prepared\xe2\x80\x9d, and there is a truth to that, but likewise there is a truth to setting out into the unknown. I guess I lie somewhere in-between, in a sort of unhappy medium; prepared for the unknown and recognizing the potential dangers but also always acknowledging the unpredictable nature of nature. The part of me that feels unprepared will never leave and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want it to.</p>
