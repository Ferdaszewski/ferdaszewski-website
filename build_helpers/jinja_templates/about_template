          <h2 class="text-center">Why?</h2>
          <p>When talking about The Walk with people, I inevitably get the strange looks of unbelief and the question; “why are you doing this?” Strangely enough, I’m not entirely sure myself. Part of it is that ever since knowing about the PCT I have wanted to hike it and my personality is such that I would not be satisfied with hiking a few miles; I have to do the entire thing in one go. A lot of it has to do with the magnetism that Nature and the Wild has on me. I have this suspicion that this life down here in the suburban and urban lowlands is really just a farce and that the real world and real life can only be found in the hills and mountains. The Call of the Wild as London so eloquently put it. I some times am taken aback by the question of why, because the more important question for me is "why not?" How could I not set out on this adventure, striking out where only few have gone and even less have succeeded? This is just another sojourn on the journey of living.</p>
